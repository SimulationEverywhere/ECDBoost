Repository for the ECDBoost implementation of the PDEVS formalism.

# Usage

Add `-I<path_to_ecdboost> -I<path_to_ecdboost>/utilities` to your compiler options, where said path is to the directory containing the `ecboost` project.

Additionally, the `hwTime.o` and `eTime.o` object files will be needed.  
Eventually this will get changed so that the library is headers-only.
